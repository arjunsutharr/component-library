            <p>
              This kind of architecture takes into consideration the main
              components that would be developed for the resulting product. The
              designer only focuses on a high-level overview, including
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>principal components,</li>
              <li>database</li>
              <li>services</li>
              <li>
                relationships between each module/component with a brief
                description of the system.
              </li>

            <h3>Low-Level Design(LLD):</h3>
            <p>
              On the contrary, this kind of architecture considers the in-depth
              and detailed design of each component mentioned in the High-Level
              Design of the system. It exposes the logical relationship between
              different elements and a detailed description of all the modules.
              Low-Level Design includes more technical information as compared
              to High-Level Design. Low-Level Design includes the description of
              the following components:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>IP Address</li>
              <li>Class Diagrams, Sequence Diagram, Activity Diagrams</li>
              <li>VLAN and Port Numbering</li>
              <li>
                Information about all the platforms, services, and processes of
                the product would depend on
              </li>
              <li> Algorithm and pseudocode</li>
              <li>Different Classes, interfaces and the relationship between them</li>
              <li>Relationships between the modules and system features</li>
              <li>External Interface Requirements, Hardware and Software Interfaces</li>
